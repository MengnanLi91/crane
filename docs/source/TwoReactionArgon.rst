Simple Two-Reaction Argon Plasma
================================

Problem Description
-------------------

Here, we consider a simple argon plasma composed of electrons, atomic ions, and the background gas.
The source of ions and electrons is electron-impact ionization, and the sink is three-body recombination:

.. math::
    :label: two_reaction_mechanism

    e + Ar \to e + e + Ar^{+}

    e + Ar^{+} + Ar \to Ar + Ar
