{"text":"The rate coefficient ($k$) for an electron-impact reaction can be expressed as,\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    k = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 e}{m_e}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E\\;\\sigma(E)f(E)\\,dE,\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\sigma (E)$ is the cross-section for the reaction which is a function of $E$ the electron energy, $f(E)$ is the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) in $eV^{-3/2}$, $e$ and $m_e$ are the charge and mass of the electron, respectively. The EEDF in $eV^{-3/2}$ is also known as electron energy probability function.  \n\n\\section{Generalised form of EEDF}\n\nThe generalized form of the EEDF (in $eV^{-3/2})$ can be expressed as,\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    f(E) = c_1 T_{eff}^{-\\frac{3}{2}} \\; e^{-c_2 (E/T_{eff})^x},\n\\end{equation} \\label{Eq EEDF}\nwhere\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    c_1 = x \\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\dfrac{3}{2}} \\dfrac{[\\Gamma(5/2x)]^{(3/2)}}{[\\Gamma(3/2x)]^{(5/2)}}; \\\\\n    c_2 = x \\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^{\\dfrac{3}{2}} \\left[\\dfrac{\\Gamma(5/2x)} {\\Gamma(3/2x)}\\right]^x.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe $x$ and $T_{eff}$ are the two adjustable parameters; $T_{eff}$ is the effective (or mean) electron temperature, and $x$ can be varied between 1 and 2. $x=1$ reduces the generalised form to Maxwellian, and $x=2$ to Druyvesteyn.$\\Gamma(\\xi)$ is the usual gamma function. \n\nMaxwellian EEDF: \nWhen $x = 1$, the generalised EEDF form presented in equation~\\ref{Eq EEDF} reduces to Maxwellian distribution.","to":"rst","from":"latex","standalone":false,"embed-resources":false,"table-of-contents":false,"number-sections":false,"citeproc":false,"html-math-method":"plain","wrap":"auto","highlight-style":null,"files":{},"template":null}
