BOLSIG+
========

In this tutorial we show how to obtain rate coefficients from 
`BOLSIG+ <http://www.bolsig.laplace.univ-tlse.fr/>`_
and format them for use in CRANE. 

BOLSIG+ is a Boltzmann solver for electron energies from 0.01 eV to 1 MeV. It
is available at http://www.bolsig.com. The BOLSIG+ code is free for academic
use. The BOLSIG+ code is written in Fortran 90 and is distributed as a
stand-alone executable. The code is also available as a Python module, which
is used here. The Python module is distributed under the GNU General Public
License v3.0.
